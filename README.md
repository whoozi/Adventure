# Adventure #

Adventure (a working title, obviously) is an action-adventure game being made in Unity. It is inspired by the likes of Terraria, Minecraft, and The Legend of Zelda.

### How does it play? ###

I plan for it to play kind-of like a top-down Terraria with more of an emphasis on exploration, with combat akin to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, all while wrapped in a cube-based world.
